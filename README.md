# The framework for wind turbine failure prediction


Machine learning applied to wind turbines incipient fault detection. This is a project staterd in my Master's degree and it is core. [The full dissertation is available here](Dissertation.pdf). 

> The full text is currently being translated to English. Right now only portuguese is available for the dissertation.

There are a few publications that concerns this project. Some are published and some are in still in revision.
I'll post them out here as soon as they are released.
